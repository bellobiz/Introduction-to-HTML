<span>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</span>
<h2>HTML Anatomy</h2>
HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Let’s take a look at how they’re written.

The <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/html+lesson+image.svg'>diagram</a> to the right  displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of one opening tag (&lt;p&gt;), the content (“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (&lt;/p&gt;). A tag and the content between it is called an <strong>HTML element</strong>. There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

Let’s quickly review each part of the element <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/html+lesson+image.svg'>pictured</a>:

<b>HTML element</b> (or <b>simply, element</b>) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

<b>HTML Tag</b> — the element name, surrounded by an opening (&lt;) and closing (&gt;) angle bracket.

<b>Opening Tag</b> — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

<b>Content</b> — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

<b>Closing tag</b> — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.
