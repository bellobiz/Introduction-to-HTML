Ordered Lists
Ordered lists (<ol>) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
</ol>

The output will look like this:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.
Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.
Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.
