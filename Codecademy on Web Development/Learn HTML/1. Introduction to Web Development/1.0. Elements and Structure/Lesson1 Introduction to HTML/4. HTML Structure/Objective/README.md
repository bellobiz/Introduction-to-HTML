<p><em>HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships</em>. As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <code><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></code> tags within <code><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></code> tags. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the <em>child</em> of that element. The child element is said to be <em>nested</em> inside of the <em>parent</em> element.</p>

<p>In the example above, the <code><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></code> element is nested inside the <code><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></code> element. The <code><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></code> element is considered a child of the <code><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></code> element, and the <code><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></code> element is considered the parent. You can also see that we’ve added two spaces of indentation (using the space bar) for better readability.</p>

<p>Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as <em>hierarchy</em>.</p>
<p>
Let’s consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:

<p>In this example, the <code><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></code> element is the parent of the <div> element. Both the <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> and <code><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></code> elements are children of the <code><b>&lt;div&gt;</b></code> element. Because the <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> and <code><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></code> elements are at the same level, they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> element.</p>

<p>
Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element. You’ll learn more about webpage hierarchy when you start digging into CSS.
